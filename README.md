# Heres an explanation if it makes sense idk im dumb

ok so its kinda simple


first line you write:

# function opponentNoteHit()

this basically reads that when the opponent hits the notes then yknow yknow

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

next lines would be:

	health = getProperty('health')
	if getProperty('health') > 0.1 then
	setProperty('health', health- 0.02);


the first line which is:
health = getProperty('health)

this is getting the health property like that

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the next line is:
if getProperty('health') > 0.1 then

which basically is like, if the property health is greater than 0.1, every opponent notes drails the health

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

which is what the third line is for:
setProperty('health', health- 0.02);

which means that if the health is greater than 0.1, the opponent notes drains by 0.02 or whatever idk

IM DUMB BASICALLY IT DRAINS HEALTH IDK HOW TO EXPLAINUHJ8DSAHYUDSAHYUIDAS

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, after that you put:

	end
	end


this is self explanatory
but if you arent code smort

it ends the line.
